# Lava Flow

This module allows you to import your notes from Obsidian MD into Foundry journal entries.

## Features

- Select your whole vault or even just one folder within it. Or even just any folder with .md files.
- Replaces Obsidian links with journal entry links in Foundry.
- Overwrite or ignore existing journal entries.
- Give your players permission to observe all notes or not during import.
- Optional index Journal entry which lists all your notes under their top-level folder.
- Optional "Reference" section which adds backlinks to each journal entry, similar to Obsidian MD's backlinks.
- Optionally import your images and have them embedded in your journal entries.
- All created folders have the flag "lavaFlowFolder" and likewise journal entries will have the flag "lavaFlowJournalEntry".

## Compatibility Matrix

I highly recommend using Foundry v10, as the latest version of this module will have the best functionality and latest bug fixes.
| Lava Flow Version | Foundry Version |
| -- | -- |
| v1.\* | v9 |
| v2.\* | v10 |
| v3.\* | v11 |

## How to Use

1. Name the top journal folder you wish to place your notes in. If this folder does not already exist, it will be created. Leaving this blank will place your notes directly into your journal entries.
1. Select the folder you wish to import. This can be any folder within your vault, including the root, or any folder with markdown files.
1. Select if you wish to overwrite journal entries that already exist with the same name in the same folder.
   - (Optional) If you do not wish to overwrite existing journal entries, you can choose to skip duplicates.
1. Select if all players should have the [Observer](https://foundryvtt.com/article/users/) permission on the notes that get imported.
1. Select if you wish to create an Index journal entry. This lists links to every imported entry, organized by their top-level folder.\

1. Select if you wish to create backlinks in each imported journal entry. This creates a "Reference" section to the end of each journal entry, linking to all the journal entries that reference it.\

1. If you want to import images, select "Import non-markdown files". By default, this uses local storage, you can also select S3 storage.

## Known Issues

- Folder depth is limited to Foundry's folder depth limit.
- Obsidian Canvas files are not supported. These will be ignored.
- Foundry Desktop app: Issues with selecting a folder and having no files import
  - Older versions of Electron, which the Foundry app uses, have a bug with selecting folders.
  - This impacts all v9 installs.
  - This _can_ impact v10 and newer if you previously had a v9 install and upgraded Foundry via the app instead of through a v10 installer.
  - If you experience this in v10+, try installing using a new installer. Please take all appropriate caution, such as backing up your user data, as you would with any upgrade.
- Not all Obsidian markdown is supported in Foundry.
  - Callouts are formatted as block quotes.
  - Code blocks work, but do not have syntax highlighting.
  - Comments
  - Diagrams
  - Embeds: These are still linked, but the text is not populated within the page's content.
  - Footnotes
  - Highlighting
  - Obsidian URI links: you should not need these anyway since you would not want to link from the Foundry server's file system. Use normal `[[Links]]`.
  - Math using Mathjax.
  - Tasks are formatted as lists with `[x]` instead of checkboxes. Still readable, but not as clean.
